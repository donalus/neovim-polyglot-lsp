* neovim-polyglot-lsp

I'm trying to figure out this whole neovim + LSP thing, so maybe not the 
best place for others to look. Maybe you can learn from my mistakes?

Here are my current goals:
- LSP for Python, Rust, Clojure
- Autocomplete
- Treesitter
- Telescope because it is an awesome fuzzy finder

There are better people to learn from. These have been influential to me:
- https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nvim-fennel-lsp-conjure-as-clojure-ide
- https://sharksforarms.dev/posts/neovim-rust/
